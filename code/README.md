### Testing against benchmark
For testing locally, you can run the **benchmark VM** in a headless mode. 

Set up the following port forwarding rule in the VirtualBox VM network settings
- Forward Host 8888 -> Guest 80

To see if it works, visit `http://localhost:8888` on your Host machine using your browser. You should be greeted with the `http://target.com` website.
